# MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
-----------------------------
## PROBLEM STATEMENT AND APPROACH

Our project aims at constructing a recommendation system to filter out movies for the user based on various parameters. We're making use of the Content Based Filter to serve our purpose.  
The problem is segregated into a few steps:

A. Data Collection  
B. Data Cleaning  
C. EDA  
D. Recommendaton System  
We built two content based systems; one that took movie overview and taglines as input and the other which took metadata such as cast, crew, genre and keywords to generate predictions. In addition, a simple filter was also used to recomment the movies with more votes and higher ratings.
